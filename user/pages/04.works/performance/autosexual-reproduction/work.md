**The Center for Autosexual Reproduction | 2011**
Collaboration with Nina Sarnelle
Medium: Theater for One Interactive Performance


The Center for Autosexual Reproduction was a medical clinic installed in a storefront space on the first floor of the Bakery Square Complex in Pittsburgh, PA.

Through the windows of the storefront a small waiting room is visible, where participants wait for their name to be called. One person at a time enters the performance space, which is an enormous area beyond the waiting room façade. The subsequent experience is structured somewhat like an amusement park ride, providing a full sensory experience that is confrontational, visceral, and absurd. Each personal performance lasts 10-15 mins, depositing the participant out a back exit on Bakery Square Boulevard.

The Center offered patients a short, non-invasive procedure to replace the inconvenient processes of courtship, conception, pregnancy, and birth. This new, highly efficient technique allowed anyone to progenerate, regardless of their sex, age or romantic capabilities.
