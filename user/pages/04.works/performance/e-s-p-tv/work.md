[E.S.P. TV #78](http://www.esptv.com/2015-season-five/2015/7/27/esp-tv-78)

E.S.P. TV is a collaboration between artists Scott Kiernan and Victoria Keddie that utilizes a mobile television studio to explore televisual language. They focus on the performative nature of production itself: through installations, broadcasts and live television taping events. They have built a strong network through artist collaboration, amassing an extensive archive detailing these unique explorations of performance, sound, and vision.

Live from Pittsburgh featuring Institute for New Feeling, Bill Shannon, Come Holy Spirit with Laura Jean Kahl, and Robin Vote, taped at The Shop, Pittsburgh, April 3, 2015 with live video mix and manipulation by Scott Kiernan and Victoria Keddie.
