‘Valentine Vampire: I will always love you even if you don’t love yourself’ is the most recent in a series of videos by Scott Andrew that delve into the underworld through characters that depict interests in witchcraft, shamanic rituals, the occult, hybrid monsters, and queer fetish fantasies. These works have been produced over the past decade to investigate camp, kitsch, and queer aesthetics through performative gestures. This specific video samples Dolly Parton’s ‘I Will Always Love You’ and possession scenes from ‘Penny Dreadful’ to give voice to the spirit of Valentine’s Day excess, and obsession.
