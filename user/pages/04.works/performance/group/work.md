**group - Performance with Nina Sarnelle | 2013**

group is a two-person stage performance using 90 minutes of original music and projected video. Drawing upon conventions of rock concerts, spiritual rituals, yoga classes, team-building exercises, self-help seminars and group therapy, this immersive audiovisual experience leads participants through a series of activities designed to generate intimacy, physicality and energetic connection between them. The audience will participate in karaoke chanting, breathing exercises, guided meditation, aerobic routines and more as they progress through our 7 platforms:

AGREE - VOICE - CONTACT - DIGEST - ACT - BREATHE - RELEASE
