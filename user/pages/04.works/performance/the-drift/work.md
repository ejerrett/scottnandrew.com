**The Drift - Performance Series | 2012-2016**

The Drift is a floating platform for creative projects that explore the rivers and waterfronts within the city of Pittsburgh. In the spring of 2012, a team of six artists constructed a pair of hexagonal rafts. Since then, The Drift has hosted a series of performances, lectures, and buoyant interventions.

Drift events are funded through The Sprout Fund, Awesome Pittsburgh, Children’s Museum of Pittsburgh, Three Rivers Arts Festival, and Carnegie Mellon University.

Projects Scott has performed or exhibited in have included Drift by Drag, Azimuth, Sycamore Colony, Floating Projections, Duck Call Orchestra, and Iceburgh, all of which more information can be found on the drift website.
