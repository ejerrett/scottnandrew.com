**Activated Anamorphs: Performative Inhabitables and Interactive Prostheses | 2021**

This interdisciplinary studio course presents a hybrid of relationships between wearable sculpture and prosthetics, movement and identity-based performance for video, social media, experimental fashion and live performance. The course emphasizes hands-on experience, the development of visual skills, craftsmanship, conceptual development, and performance techniques. Students will design and fabricate performative devices that alter, augment, mask, and transform the body and its inherent abilities. The course culminates in a series of live performance events in collaboration with the School of Music’s Exploded Ensemble and other guest artists (TBD).

Various lectures, workshops, activities, presentations, and critiques will be included as an integral part of the learning process. Guest instructors from across the College of Fine Arts and outside of the institution will provide lectures, and workshops that offer students multiple perspectives and techniques. Students will work in a variety of media, including sculptural approaches with fabric, papier-mâché, ready-made and recycled materials that investigate new ways to interact with our physical environment(s) through exploration in the adaptation, translation, enhancement, exaggeration, modification, and mutation of the human body. These constructions are then activated through performance gestures for photo, live and prerecorded video, social media platforms, and live and interactive events.
