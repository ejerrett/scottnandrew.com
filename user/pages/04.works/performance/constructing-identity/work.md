**Constructing Identitiy | 2013**

Constructing Identity was a project funded by a MAKESHOP Micro Mini Grant from the Children's Museum of Pittsburgh. LGBTQIA youth were given the opportunity to spend the summer at the Gay and Lesbian Community Center of Pittsburgh, creating costumes that represent their personal identity or mythology. Performing in the fashion show as part of the MAKESHOP Makerfaire are Scott Andrew, Dalron Grady, Tori Novak , and Stephanie Ross. The segment was edited by Rachel Wagner for Trans-Q Television Episode 1.
