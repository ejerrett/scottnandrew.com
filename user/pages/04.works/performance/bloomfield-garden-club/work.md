**Bloomfield Garden Club | 2020**

In August 2020, TD Projects (Tina Dillman, independent artist and curator) in partnership with Burning Well (Bill Julin, Bloomfield Resident) launched the Bloomfield Garden Club (BGC), a monthly salon highlighting local artists in residence working in dance, music, comedy, literary, visual, and/or performance art. John Musser w/  Scott Andrew performed as August Artists-in-Residence with  Naomi Chambers, and Betty Douglas w/ Rex Trimm.

The goal of the BGC is to provide an experimental platform for local artists from various backgrounds to create new work in the dawn of this awakening hour, and to provide sources of revenue for those that are the most vulnerable. BGC will showcase local artists that identify as female, queer, anti-colonizer, person of color, or have always felt like they were the outliers. Tina Dillman’s vision: “The communities I create are inclusive of any background, race, class, gender profile, as there is only one way forward and that is to ensure that we all rise together. There is no world that I want to be in that exists without artists, as we are the backbone of every society-we document, we create, we breathe, we speak truth to power, and we dream up new ideas that have the ability to transform old civilizations into new beginnings.”
