The Diva Saga: The Legend of the Worst Drag Queen, is a multi-channel video installation and live performance piece that questions constructions of sexuality, gender, and identity in a digital age and examines how Veronica Bleaus became the self-proclaimed ‘worst drag queen.’ Lampooning normative and restrictive constructions of sex, artistic judgment, and popular culture, The Diva Saga draws heavily from numerous visual and aural storytelling mediums like comic books, Japanese anime, video games, music videos, and high fantasy.

A series of campy confrontations between a live Veronica and the avatars of drag—digital identities projected on stage (also played by Veronica)—the live and digital Veronicas clash in their respective interpretations, battling each other in a fantastic, campy visual and sonic narrative. A Drag Saga uses live and digital performance to gesture to and capture the importance of camp and divas in queer processes of self-making and alternative identity construction.

This work integrates videos and performances based on Stevie Nicks, Whitney Houston, Nomi Ruiz, Kylie Minogue, Róisín Murphy, Grace Jones, Kate Bush, with original music content by Scott Andrew and John Musser.

The Diva Saga was previewed at Fail-Safe, a variety format performance series for work-in-progress, and was debuted in full at the Tawes Theater in the Gibson Center for the Arts, as part of the CMS speaker series and artist residency at Washington College in Chestertown, MD.
