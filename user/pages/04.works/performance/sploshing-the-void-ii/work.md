**Sploshing the Void II, in collaboration with Mitsuko Verdery | 2012**

The second version of this work is a kinetic multi-channel video Installation with movement-based performance by Mitsuko Verdery. This immersive installation and performance is a perceptually disorienting imagination of gazing into the void; a nauseating and hallucinogenic inter-dimensional portal, where thermographic doppelgängers loom and vanish into the distance.

Blending kitsch and fetish, this work transports viewers into a world of cyber animal-human hybrids, sploshing yet sterile liquids, and crystal tornados. The viewer gains the perspective of having been shrunk in size, while passing through the animated imagery to experience a representation of the permeability of time and space.

This installation also sets out to expose matter as a 'useful fiction', where people's bodies are 'more like a wave than a permanent thing', to quote Richard Dawkins in his lecture on the Queer Universe. Where nothingness is thought of as emptiness, nonexistence, and void, the conception of nothingness can also be viewed as a gateway, a form or process that is ever-moving through the flow and flux of all things.
