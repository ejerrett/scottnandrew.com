Ponycorn Apocalypse featuring Dani Lamorte, Stephanie Ross and Harrison Apple | 2014

This performance was created to celebrate the end of the world.

How would you want to spend your day if it were the last day for all existence?
At an orgy in the midst of a mating ritual around a larger-than-life glowing crystal with the four ponycorns of the apocalypse?
We thought so.

This performance is a playful response to the end of the Mayan calendar and the seemingly never-ending supply of post apocalyptic and natural disaster tropes that fill our world and contribute to the 'end times' hysteria that is ingrained in society. We intend to take an absurdist jab at these reoccurring narratives while replacing them with symbols of eternal peace, love, life and feasting. We see a future that glimmers infinitely beyond the heat-death of the universe itself.
