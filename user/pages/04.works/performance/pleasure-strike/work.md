**Pleasure Strike! - Performance with Stephanie Ross | 2013**

Pleasure Strike is a performance that blends the Freudian Oedipus complex and Mixed Martial Arts fighting with the legend of the Vegetable Lamb of Tartary and elements of Jim Henson’s the Dark Crystal. In this life cycle gone wrong, a gelatinous uterine seedpod mutates, metamorphosises, loves, cries, lies, and collides. How would you feel if your mutant afterbirth feel in love with you and then tried to kill you? Who will win this unending battle of pleasure versus pain, violence versus seduction? How will this cellular showdown unfold? Experience the sad truth in Pleasure Strike!!!
