**Art Olympics Theater | 2010**

THE TRANS-MILLENNIAL CONQUISTADORS!!!

The Trans-Millennial Conquistadors - Scott Andrew, Adam Atkinson, Michael McParlane and Josh Tonies - have arrived from the Giant _Ag_e in the Pittsburgh of June 2008, ready to disrupt the fabric of space-time with their contagious future-diseases, inflatable time pods and - finally - a climactic, cacophonous time transit!!!!!!!

They will try to convince you of their good intentions, their superior future-intellect and the logic of their strange customs - but be cautious, denizens of the "year" 2008!!!

They will claim that their shimmering technology is a means to orient the time team to this exotic frontier. They will insist that their time pods are an infallible conduit of time-space. They will encourage your cooperation in their ritual of using sound to cleanse the time-waves!!!

Only your own imagination, intuition and participation will help you determine whether these Trans-Millennial Conquistadors are friend, foe or something else altogether!!!!!!!!!!!!
