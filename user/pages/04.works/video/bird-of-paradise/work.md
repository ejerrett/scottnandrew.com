**Bird of Paradise | single channel video | 2015**

Bird of Paradise is a ritualistic vignette that explores a dimensional shift into a queerer time and place within rural Appalachia. It is a character study that brings forward a new possible existence within this space that could be happening in the distant past, future, or another realm all together. This work is a video document as means of metaphysical archeology that digs into an alternate universal space. The work peers into a window of alternative forms of masculinity, narcissistic self-adornment, transfixed hallucinations, and a hybridized human/animal body, to result in a hypnotizing gender queer fantasy.
