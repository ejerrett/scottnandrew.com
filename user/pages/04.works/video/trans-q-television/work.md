Trans-Q Television - Online Television Series | 2012

Scott Andrew is a coproducer of Trans-Q Television.

Trans-Q Television is a playful and provocative video variety show reveling in the mutability of genders and sexualities. Collaborating with a wide range of talent we create programs that include music, performance, comedy, fashion, stand-up theory, interviews, animation, literary presentations and more. A Dadaist Variety Show for the 21st Century, Trans-Q Television is a truly twisted mix of Sonny and Cher, The Muppet Show, Andy Warhol’s TV, Ernie Kovacs, Flip Wilson and Pee Wee’s Playhouse!

Featured Artists include Vaginal Davis, LE1f, Alaska Thunderfuck 5000, Zackary Drucker and Rhys Ernst, Mikey McParlane, Erica Gressman, Narcissister, Veruca La’Piranha, Ssion, Jason Martin, Pyuupiru, and many more.
