**AI Dreams of Electric Bodies | 2023**

This work is an experimental merger of AI generated animation elements created with Deforum Stable Diffusion that has undergone a blend of After Effects and Premiere editing techniques, paired with Ableton Live and MaxMSP audio visual synthesis effects to create a cosmic bodily dreamscape that imagines how Artificial Intelligence and synthesizing technologies may fantasize and extrapolate visions of bodily pleasure, transformation and desire.
