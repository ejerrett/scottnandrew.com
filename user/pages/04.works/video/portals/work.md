**Portals | Video | 2020**

Portals is a short video experiment as part of the Miller ICA’s ‘Looking Out’ a photo and video series in response to Covid-19. This work is an extension of Scott and Jesse’s first collaboration at KST’s Alloy Studios during their Freshworks Residency in March of 2020. The two artists explore how dance and media arts overlap to render otherworldly portals of nostalgia, celebrity, and fantasy. In this work, a figure both sublime and grotesque masquerades through a chaotic storm framed within the windowpane.” headpiece design by @pisssy_pusssy
