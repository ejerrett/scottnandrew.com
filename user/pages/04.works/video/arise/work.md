**ARISE single channel video | 2008**

Arise was initially debuted at the Creative Arts College on West Virginia University’s campus. After revisiting this work over the course of several years it reached its final state and was displayed in the 2008 Pittsburgh Filmmakers ‘Uncensored’ screening series.

Arise holistically represents my video work and VJ performances from 2004-2008. It merges excerpts from past projects, performances, and experiments with video feedback loops, static, analog television distortions, digital encoding irregularities, and re-recorded projections onto bodies and other surfaces. Found footage, pornography, and films such as Brazil, 2001: Space Odyssey, Dune, Adaptation, Mirror Mask, Xanadu, and Koyaanisqatsi were also sampled in production. Arise dreams of weightlessness, space, flight, and the exchange of energy currents through subatomic particles, our bodies, and the cosmos.
