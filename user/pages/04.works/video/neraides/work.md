Description: In 'Neráides, Fall of the Subterrestrial Hive’, a fay fantasy world unravels. A cinematic narrative is revealed where boys play with ponies while frolicking limp wrested and glitter skinned through the forest and an alien drag queen commands an army of flying penis monsters. Kitschy materials and a camp aesthetic develop a form of gaudy decadence that is aware of its own excess by recycling aspects derived from opulent Hollywood glamour, fashion, and ritual. This project breaks down traditional conceptions of masculinity and exposes characters outside of heteronormative societal constraints by placing them in invented environments that reside in an alternate time and place. A sense of prelapsarian longing emerges from this fantasy world through characters like the temptress Deleásei, a dominant yet flamboyant tribe leader who prances in the nude (with the exception of his lace corset and sparkling headdress), Brávous, the submissive masochistic henchmen, and Chrysós, the mysterious golden warrior. Other characters include Joe the Pony, the penis monsters, who grow from the forest floor like fungi, and their ruler, queen of the Subterrestrial Hive, Krustallos Vasilissa. She is the Queen of crystal and ice, forever trapped in a glowing underground palace. Many shimmering umbilical cords serve as erogenous zones that imprison her while giving her sustenance through a symbiotic relationship. Will the temptress and his tribe be strong enough to overcome this delirium inducing siren? Who will survive the Fall of the Subterrestrial Hive, as Krustallos' seductively operatic voice entices her victims towards the brink of death? Watch as the fantasy unfolds in Neráides, Fall of the Subterrestrial Hive.
