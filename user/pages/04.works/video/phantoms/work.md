**Phantoms - Video | 2014**

Phantoms is a single channel video that features 3D animated diamonds containing characters from my previous installation ‘Gilding the Lily’. Like Superman trapped in the Phantom Zone, these shards of alter egos tumble and hurdle through a psychedelic vortex. Prominent themes in the work include portals to other worlds, voids and vortexes, entrapment, and the need to break free.
