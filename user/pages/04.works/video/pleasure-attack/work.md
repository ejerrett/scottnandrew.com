**Pleasure Attack! | 2010**

Video by Scott Andrew and Erin Womack as shown at the event BYOB at SPACE gallery.

Pleasure Attack! is the first collaboration between Scott Andrew and Erin Womack. Erin and Scott both explore issues of gender, desire, escapism, fantasy, and ritual in their work. They have crafted independently identifiable aesthetics over the past decade through the mediums of illustration, film, video, performance, installation, and photography. Upon meeting each other, the artists were curious to see what would happen when their two distinct realms of art making collided. The ideas that organically grew out of this collision quickly focused around the characters from each artist's world. Scott and Erin improvised with each other, finding common ground in the interest to attack each other's characters with pleasure!
