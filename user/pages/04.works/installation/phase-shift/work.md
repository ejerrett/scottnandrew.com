**Phase Shift | Multimedia Installation | 2015**

Phase-Shift is a full-sensory installation, that is named after an illegal cloaking technology in Star Trek Next Generation Episode 164. In the context of this multimedia installation, the term can be interpreted to imply a shift between multiple phases of being, neighboring dimensions, artistic movements, and morphing personalities.

Prominent reoccurring themes in the work include portals to other worlds, voids and vortices, entrapment, and the need to break free. The work is discursive of investigations into alternative forms of masculinity, body modification, and gender queer fantasy. Other interests include the permeability of space-time, post-humanism, and a form of metaphysical archeology that digs into other realities.

This installation integrates three new video portraits of the characters named, 'Shore Whore', 'Cat Bath', and 'Golden Girl'. Other elements include a Rococo chandelier, and a floor projection/installation that pulls from past works, 'Phantoms', and Śarkarā.
