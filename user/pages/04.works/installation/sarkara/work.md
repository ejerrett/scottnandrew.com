**śarkarā | Multimedia Installation | 2014**

The title śarkarā is taken from the Sanskrit word for ‘sugar’, which is the predominant material used in the installation. Alternate related definitions for śarkarā include: a hardening of the flesh, and a fragment or piece of earthenware, potsherd.

Sugar is laid out into a circular floor projection surface that is reminiscent of a space delineated for spirit conjuring or entrapment. This space is lined with six clear vessels that are filled with various materials such as sprinkles, a chocolate makeup kit, and a glass high-heal shoe filled with glittery syrup, among other objects and materials that reference offerings or ingredients for a ritual. Contained within the circle are several sugar cast faces that are created using a Mexican sugar skull technique commonly used in celebrations of ‘Dia de los Muertos’. These faces are open mouthed with closed eyes, resembling a mass grave. Some of the mouths spew icing and marshmallows which make reference to over-consumption, and loosely evoke the phrase ‘death by chocolate’.

A video vortex spins within the sugar sculptural surface and intertwines an otherworldly candied drag monster, complete with a sprinkle-coated face and a school of pet chocolate fish among other hyper-colored garments and flowing sugary demons. Accompanying the video is a soundscape that is predominantly comprised of an incantation that rummages through the etymological history of the word ‘sugar’. This work conflates campy faux witchcraft and resurrection spells with notions of mortality and cultural excess.
