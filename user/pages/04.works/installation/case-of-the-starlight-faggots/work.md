**The Case of the Starlit Faggots | Video | 2018**

The Case of the Starlit Faggots is a video and installation created by Scott Andrew and Atom Atkinson. This project is based on an original selection of poems by the same name written by Atom Atkinson. The video component features Veronica Bleaus, Dani Lamorte, Atom Atkinson, Scott Andrew, Ethan Jerrett, Harrison Apple, and Jonathan Armistead. The greater video installation which premiered in Identity Play at SPACE in Pittsburgh, PA, reveals an anachronistic domestic space, built around the video, which like the writing, follows the cutup style and form of an erasure poem. The video is staged as a degraded noir film, aiding the dialogue with a visual context of the queer detective fantasy worlds it sets out to represent.
