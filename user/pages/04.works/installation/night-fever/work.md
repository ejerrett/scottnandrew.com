**Night Fever at Future Tenant, Pittsburgh PA | 2017**

Participating Artists: Scott Andrew, Androxx, Hilary Harp and Suzie Silver, Gabriel Martinez, Adam Milner, Devan Shimoyama, Pacifico Silano, and Bradley Wester

Night Fever examines the aesthetic legacy of disco through a diverse multigenerational group of local and national contemporary artists who engage with the bygone era of mirror balls, disco divas, and transformative nights of dancing. While disco and its cultural impact have often been brushed off as too artificial, too commercial and too kitsch, Night Fever will emphasize Alice Echol’s assertion from Hot Stuff: Disco and the Remaking of American Culture that “disco…broadened the contours of blackness, femininity and male homosexuality.” The artists in Night Fever use disco to create a rich dialogue about the communities, performances and self-fashioned identities that emerged through the music and clubs.
