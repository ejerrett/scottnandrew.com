**Sploshing the Void (prototype) 3 channel video installation | 2011**

This immersive installation creates the effect of gazing into the void of an interdimensional portal, where doppelgängers loom and vanish into the distance. Much like Dorothy being caught up inside of the tornado, the viewer witnesses an array of larger-than-life kitschy objects, sploshing liquids, and body parts that swirl through controlled feedback loops. Many simulacral images emerge, as the mirrored representations of the viewer appear to penetrate the animated sequences. The viewer gains the perspective of having been shrunk in size and is able to pass through solid matter, experiencing a representation of the permeability of time and space. This work sets out to expose matter as a 'useful fiction', where people's bodies are 'more like a wave than a permanent thing', to quote Richard Dawkins in his lecture on the Queer Universe.
